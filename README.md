# Graph Project
Simple project to brush up on some data structures and algorithms, 
and also to re-familiarize with C++ and learn some of the new features in 11 and 14.

# To Do:
- [ ] Graphs
  - [x] BFS traversal
  - [ ] DFS traversal
  - [ ] Djikstra's  
- [ ] Hypergraphs
  - [ ] BFS traersal
  - [ ] DFS traversal
- [ ] Simple parser with Boost Spirit
- [ ] Smart pointers
