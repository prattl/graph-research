# Graph Project
Simple project to brush up on some data structures and algorithms, 
and also to re-familiarize with C++ and learn some of the new features introduced in 11 and 14.

# To Do:
- [x] Graphs
  - [x] Data structures (adjacency lists)
  - [x] BFS traversal
  - [x] Recursive DFS traversal
  - [x] Iterative DFS traversal
  - [x] Iterative Deepening DFS traversal
- [ ] Hypergraphs
  - [x] Data structures
  - [x] BFS traversal
  - [x] DFS traversal
  - [ ] Shortest path
- [ ] Simple parser (with Boost Spirit?) to construct graphs
- [x] Smart pointers
- [ ] Use const when possible
- [ ] Move vertex & edge data to struct (pimpl)
